      <!--Small Preamble of the blog-->
      <p id="preamble">When learning to code, I first learned that a computer program can be written in different kinds of languages. Languages such as, HTML or CSS or Java Script. Even though, there are more coding languages, the ones I have just recently learned to use are HTML and CSS. Coding has taught me how to put my ideas into a webpage that I created. Here I will continue to talk about my experience learning to code and go more in depth into HTML and CSS.</p>

    <!--HTML explanation-->
    <h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
      <p id="p1">In order to code HTML I first learned what it was that HTML meant. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. This is the language which is used to put information into a website. Things such as headings, images, links, lists, paragraphs, tables, etc. With HTML the very first thing I learned to do was to have text, headings and images. The first thing was to have text and headings. In order to have a heading there are different kinds of sizes the biggest being "h1" and the smallest being "h6". The different types of headings are used in order to specify content and make sure that the viewer knows more specifically what it is that they are looking at. Also it is to make it easier for them to find information. in order to code for anything there must be an open tag and a closed tag. For instance, to code for "h1" I need to have h1 enclosed by "<>" in order top open the tag. To close the tag it is exactly the same process except there must be a slash before h1. It would look a little bit like this /h1 enclosed by "<>", the text for the heading goes in between the open and close tag in order for it to appear. After this I learned to code for a paragraph which is practically the same just that we repplace "h1" with a "p". That p stands for paragraph which is practically what it's being done a paragraph is being written. Finally an image is coded a bit differently. Images all have their unique address in the internet. An image is found by the url of the image and not the webpage it resides. To know if it's an image or not we tend to look at how the link ends. Normally images have addresses that end in ".pdf" or ".gif" among other domains. Once you have the address of the image, for it to be in your webpage it needs to be in a tag that closes itself. Here we must code for: img representing image; src representing source; and follow that with an ="". All together it looks something like: img src=""/. The image address is then inserted in between the quotation marks and the imge is encoded into the website. The size of the image can be specified with a command such as height="" or width="" though it is preferable to only code for one and let the computer do the math in order to avoid ruinning the quality of the image. Also the alt="" is a function that is used to insert a brief description of an image in order for computer programms to read out loud what it is that the image is displaying.</p>
      <p id="p2">While HTML codes for more than just these 3 things. For instance, in order to have a paragraph break, such as the one I just did, we need to code br within <> in order for the break to happen. To add emphasis to certain words we can enclose the words with the tag <em>em</em> to have emphasis on a word or use the <strong>strong</strong> tag to use some bold. We can add a table by having the tags(in this specific order): table, thead, tr, th, /th, /tr, /thead, tbody, tr, td, /td, /tr /tbody, /table. Or to have a numbred list we code: "ol" with a bunch of "li" and "/li" for every object on the list. and close the list with "/ol" the same is done for a dotted list but instead of coding "ol" we code "ul". Finally the last thing I have learned is to create a link. It is a bit easy to do link it to an external page, we just code a href="" and we paste the link to the extrenal webpage within the quotation marks. Yet, in order to do an internal link first we must create something call an "id" the id is practically the identification of anything that is in the webpage. Once you have the id for the place you want to be taken within your website you insert the id in between the quotation of a href="". The way to code something for an id is practically to have id="example" yet if we want to apply something to more objects we use soemthing called class, it works the same way an id does we just change the id for the class. And that is practically all of my knowledge of HTML as of 4 March 2019.</p>

    <!--CSS explanation-->
    <h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
    <p id="p3">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. In here it is all about giving life to the webpage. While in HTML we include content in CSS we focus more in the appreance of the webpage. With CSS we color, outline, border, align, adjust, resize, etc. As a matter of fact there are so many CSS codes that it is almost impossible for one single person to know them all, especially since they are adding new CSS codes every year. With CSS I was able to give life to my websites. To make CSS work we must work a lot with id's and class' This way we tell the program how we want to style specific things. I consider CSS to be very confusing but very interesting, this since it is hard to remember how somethings are done yet interesting because it is like a sandbox in which one can experiment with many different things and combinations.</p>
    <p id="p4">When I learned CSS I learned firstly to code for background color. I did this using the program background-color: rgb (0,0,0); which codes for the background color of something; it depends on what object the code is used for. I learned to color text with color: rgb (0,0,0); I learned to align using either the margins to center a table or image with the code: margin-right:auto; and margin-left:auto; or just simply text-align:center; This code would automatically center whatever I used this on. In Khan Academy I learned way more things such as font-family, line height, font styles and much more. Yet in some cases I did went out in the internet to figure out how certain things were done. The perfect example of this is to have a background image, I went into 3schools.org were I looked up how to have a background image. There I learned that the code for this was background-image: url="image address"; and this would code for a background image.</p>
