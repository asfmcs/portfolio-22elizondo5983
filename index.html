        <p>For the second semester of English 9 most of the time was dedicated for our own individual project. The first month, January, was dedicated to reading the kite runner. A book about two kids from afghanistan before the Soviet Union invaded in 1975. The stroy goes on through the escape from the invasion, the stay in America, and the return to afghanistan in 2001 to save his friends son. After this we started to plan out our semester project. My topic for the semester project was "Love and Human Relationships" which I spend the past semester reading and writing about it. I worked on this project from mid-february all through March. When April arrived the project got interrupted by Poetry Month. We spent the following month looking into poetry and analysining it using tools like the TPCASTT. For our final poetry project we had to do a Students On Poetry(S.O.P) video in which we had to read and write a poem related to our semester topic, plus, answer a random question. After this we had most of the month of May to finish any project we had not finished. And this conlcludes the semester with the only pending assignment is the Exposition of our Learning.</p>

Eventually, in  kite fighting tournament Amir wins the tournament and Hassan runs the kite for him. When he gets the kite he is encountered by some bullies and gets severly injured. Amir knew this since he followed him, yet, he decided to do nothing and instead ran away. Tis was the beginning of the end of their friendship. Eventually, Ali quitted his job with Baba causing Amir and Hassan never to see each other again. The Soviets invaded afghanistan some years later which forced Amir and Baba to flee.

        <p>For our second semester we had the freedom to chose a topic in which we would do research or create projects that will show a reflection of the topic. I chose to focus in the topic of Love because these days it is something that is lacking quite a lot, specially were it's needed the most; places like families or event within one self. Also I went on and explored the topic of love in the most common religion from were I live which is Roman Catholicism. Here I learned what the ideal(or something like it) form of love would be. To end my project I decided to write a short epic poem that involes a relationship, that seemes to have ended in a tragic night, yet, prevails even several years after not knowing they had survived. This is practically an overview of my semester and below are my products for this semester.</p>

        <p>In the month of April, this second semester, we had poetry month. It was a month in which we had all of our projects "paused"(we could still work on them at our own time) and we started looking more into poems and literary devices. We looked at authors that wrote poems related to our semester project, and we analyzed poems through a device called the TPCASTT which stands for Title, Paraphrase, Connotation, Attitude, Shift, Title, Theme. Our final project for this unit was to create a Students on Poetry(S.O.P) video in which we had to recite a poem from the web, a poem of our own, and answer a question. Our poem had to be related to our semester topic so the poem I chose talked about self love and the poem I wrote was about how no living thing will ever be pretty enough.</p>
